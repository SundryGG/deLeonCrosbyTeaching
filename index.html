      <p><strong>Standard 3:</strong> Learning Environments — The teacher works with others to create environments that support individual and collaborative learning, and that encourage positive social interaction, active engagement in learning, and self motivation.</p>

      <p><strong>II. Content</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Standard 4:</strong> Content Knowledge — The teacher understands the central concepts, tools of inquiry, and structures of the discipline(s) he or she teaches and creates learning experiences that make the discipline accessible and meaningful for learners to assure mastery of the content.</p>
